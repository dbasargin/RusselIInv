This console application reads lines from standard input and, upon end of file, writes the longest line to standard output. 
If there are ties for the longest line, the program writes out all the lines that tie. 
If there is no input, the program should produce no output.

This program creates a .txt file on your local machine, instructs the user to add lines to this .txt file, and displays 
the lines with the greatest length to the console window.

My Code can easily be found in the Program.cs folder with an added class, FileHelperClass.cs, which helps organize the code.
