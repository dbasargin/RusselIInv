This console application reads lines from standard input and, upon end of file, writes the longest line to standard output. 
If there are ties for the longest line, the program writes out all the lines that tie. 
If there is no input, the program should produce no output.

My Code can easily be found in the Program.cs folder with an added class, FileHelperClass.cs, which helps organize the code.
